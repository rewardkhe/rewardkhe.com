<h4> I am currently looking for entry level opportunities in web and software development roles. I am excited to collaborate with a team that fosters a culture of continuous learning and values creativity and innovation.</h4>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of working in technology is the opportunity to learn and adapt constantly. I thrive in dynamic environments where there's always something new to explore. I've been fortunate enough to work on a variety of intriguing projects during my coursework and hobby projects, from developing dynamic web applications to contributing to robust software architectures. These experiences have taught me the importance of maintaining clean code, following best practices, and adhering to industry standards. Currently, I'm particularly learning and delving into the intricacies of low latency, distributed systems, and scaling techniques.</p>
